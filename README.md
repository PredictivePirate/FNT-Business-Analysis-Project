# FNT-Business-Analysis-Project
Situation:

Throughout his career, Michael has assisted financial services in developing business cases and navigating the capital markets. He currently owns a well-established company that facilitates the trading of stocks and other financial products for companies. Recently, Michael decided to establish a consulting subsidiary within his company to aid a large institutional client in building a comprehensive trading platform. Given the nature of capital markets, this project requires a technical solution that enables all market participants to interact through a shared platform.

My Involvement as a Data Analyst:

As a data analyst working for my company, I have been directly involved in the trading system project. Michael has decided to outsource the implementation of the system to a third-party company, and our company has been chosen as one of the participants to submit specifications. This opportunity recognizes my expertise and positions me as a key contributor to the project.
Alongside my team, I am responsible for providing compelling and comprehensive specifications for the trading system. My objective is to showcase my analytical skills and technical knowledge to increase the likelihood of our company being selected to manage the system implementation. By leveraging my expertise in data analysis, I will play a crucial role in developing accurate and data-driven specifications that align with the project's requirements.
As a data analyst, I will contribute valuable insights and recommendations to the report and presentation, ensuring the inclusion of key data flow diagrams, swimlane diagrams, and use case diagrams. My contributions will help shape the overall design of the system navigation and provide a strong foundation for the successful implementation of the trading platform.
My involvement as a data analyst is vital in demonstrating our company's capabilities and distinguishing it from other competitors. By delivering meticulous and insightful analysis, I aim to enhance our company's chances of being selected for this prestigious project.
